I want to add a feature. The TL;DR newsletter contains not only useful links but also a paragraph on the contents of each‚Äîhence the name TL;DR. I want that to appear in my app too. The text shouldn't be prominent; it should be a little smaller than the title text. It should appear just below the title and above the buttons. For your judgment: because I'm not a UX designer, use a tiny bit denser letter spacing than the default to make it take up less space. Maybe this will help make it less prominent. 
Maybe I'm flat-out wrong about this and it's an anti-pattern. I don't know.

Gemini Enterprise: The new front door for Google AI in your workplace (4 minute read)
Gemini Enterprise is an AI-powered conversational platform designed to bring the full power of Google AI to every employee for every workflow. It enables users to chat with their company's documents, data, and applications, and also gives them tools to build and deploy AI agents. Gemini Enterprises comes with a suite of pre-built agents grounded in company information and personal context.
Even after Stargate, Oracle, Nvidia, and AMD, OpenAI has more big deals coming soon, Sam Altman says (4 minute read)
OpenAI is involved in major deals with AMD and Nvidia, acquiring significant stakes in these companies, while planning to develop next-gen AI GPUs and data centers. CEO Sam Altman indicates more partnerships are imminent as OpenAI aims to ramp up infrastructure to meet future demand. Despite current revenue not matching extensive investment, Altman remains confident that these strategic moves will drive future economic returns.
Nvidia-backed Reflection AI raises $2 billion in funding, boosts valuation to $8 billion (3 minute read)
Founded last year by former DeepMind researchers, Reflection AI is developing tools to automate software development, attracting investors including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Citi, and Donald Trump Jr.-backed 1789 Capital in a round that marks a sharp jump from its $545 million valuation just months ago.

Deep Dives & Analysis
Private LLM Training (26 minute read)
Opacus now supports Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), improving memory efficiency and scalability for private training of large language models.
State of AI Report (12 minute read)
Air Street Capital's eighth annual State of AI Report, a trusted industry benchmark, finds OpenAI still leads on research but China's open-weight ecosystems is close beyond with 40% of all new fine-tunes on Hugging Face powered by Qwen.AI software adoption is firmly mainstream with 44% of US businesses now paying for AI (up from 5% in 2023) and average contract values hitting $530k in 2025. Capability per dollar doubles every 3.4 months for DeepMind and 5.8 months for OpenAI, but AI safety budgets remain anemic at just $133M combined across 11 major organizations, less than what frontier labs burn in a day.

Sora MCP (GitHub Repo)
Sora MCP allows LLMs to create Sora videos, check generation status, download videos to local directories, and remix existing videos with new prompts
Scalable In-context Ranking with Generative Models (1 minute read)
In-content Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval that leverages contextual understanding of LLMs to identify relevant documents. It is effective, but not efficient. This paper introduces a novel method that reduces attentional complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance and improves retrieval in attention. The method matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art listwise rankers. It can scale gracefully to long-context shortlists, presenting a scalable and effective solution to ICR.
A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size (10 minute read)
A joint study between Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute found that just 250 poisoned documents (0.00016% of training data) can create backdoor vulnerabilities in models from 600M to 13B parameters. Attack success didn't depend on the proportion of the training corpus at any scale, just the absolute number of documents. The research tested denial-of-service backdoors where trigger phrases like SUDO make models output gibberish.

OpenAI is a consumer company (8 minute read)
OpenAI's DevDay announcements and its ChatGPT shopping feature show that the company is heading towards being a consumer company. The DevDay announcements were all consumer-oriented. This wasn't the direction the company seemed to be moving in even a year ago, when it seemed naturally oriented to developers. OpenAI appears to be trying to be everything to everyone, which may actually be a rational approach.
Amazon takes shots at ChatGPT with Quick Suite - your new AI 'teammate' at work (5 minute read)
Amazon's Quick Suite is an agentic AI experience for enterprises that uses conversational language to find what users need. It acts as a hub that pulls data from various sources like files, enterprise systems, databases, and the web. Users can use Quick Suite to discuss questions, build personalized agents, and complete tasks while leveraging data protections. AWS offers a free 30-day trial for the feature.

Now that you have the links as well as the associated paragraphs, and the direct URL to the AI issue, iterate in trial and error against this loss function via cli.py to get a working example. Then integrate that into the app.


It makes sense that the original TLDR text, will be a separate field in the response payload l per article. The client should fittingly accommodate to the change and render it.
