Bottom line: A Sydney resident died after an older Samsung phone, left on outdated software, couldn’t call 000; carrier TPG says its network was fine, blames a known compatibility issue on legacy Galaxy models, and notes it followed rules that can block unpatched devices from emergency calling.

## What happened
- A Lebara (on TPG) customer died after failing to reach 000; TPG’s ASX filing says its network was operational and early probes point to a Samsung device running software no longer compatible with emergency calling ([ASX PDF](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TPG/03024249.pdf)).
- Samsung has flagged “certain older devices” and lists models requiring updates or replacement to ensure Triple Zero calls work (e.g., Galaxy S7/Note 5 series) ([Samsung list](https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/issue-with-some-older-galaxy-devices-calling-triple-zero/)).
- TPG says it warned affected users multiple times, most recently Nov 7; the victim’s handset wasn’t updated.

## Policy, blame, and warnings
- Under Australia’s Emergency Service Call Determination, operators must block handsets that can’t complete 000 if not fixed within 28–35 days after first warning; TPG says it complied.
- Telstra previously warned that older, non‑upgradeable Samsung devices could fail 000 and face mandatory blocking across all networks ([Telstra post](https://www.telstra.com.au/exchange/older-mobile-devices-calling-triple-zero-)).
- TPG notified federal/state authorities, ACMA, and the Triple Zero Custodian; disclosure made due to public concern over 000 reliability.

## Statements and context
- CEO Iñaki Berroeta: 
> “This is a tragic incident... We urge all customers with outdated software to replace or update their devices without delay.”
- Samsung (post‑publication): expressed condolences; urged customers to keep devices updated and said it’s working with carriers to ensure reliability.
- Context: Optus earlier admitted a firewall update blocked emergency calls for 14 hours, linked to three deaths ([report](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/21/optus_emergency_call_incident/)).
