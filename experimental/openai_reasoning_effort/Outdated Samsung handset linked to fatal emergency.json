TPG disclosed the incident to the ASX, saying its network was fully operational and pointing to the phone\u2019s outdated software as the cause. [Statement](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TPG/03024249.pdf)\n- **Devices at risk:** Samsung says \u201ccertain older devices\u201d need updating/replacing to make Triple Zero calls; it lists dozens of affected models (e.g., Galaxy S7, Note 5).
