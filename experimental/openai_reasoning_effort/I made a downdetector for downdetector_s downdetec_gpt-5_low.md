# I made a downdetector for downdetector's downdetector's downdetector

**URL:** https://downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com

**Model:** gpt-5

**Reasoning Effort:** low

**Time:** 25.42s

Bottom line: A tongue-in-cheek, 4×-meta status page that pings a meta-checker via a tiny API; currently “Checking…” and unaffiliated.

# TL;DR
> “A tiny independent status checker that checks the checker that checks the checker that checks Downdetector.”

- **What**: An independent “4× Downdetector” status page for [downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com](https://downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com/).
- **How**: Calls a small API that pings [Downdetector’s Downdetector’s Downdetector](https://downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com/) and reports back.
- **Status now**: Global probe: “Checking…”; HTTP/Latency: —/—; Last checked: just now; Target: [link](https://downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com/).
- **Affiliation**: Not linked to any prior detectors, Downdetector, or your ISP.
- **Action**: Refresh to recheck.
