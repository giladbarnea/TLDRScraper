**Model:** gpt-5.1

**Reasoning Effort:** low

**Time:** 174.01s

**Bottom line:** An Australian died after an old Samsung phone couldn’t call 000. The carrier says its network worked; outdated Samsung software broke emergency calling. Regulators force telcos to block such unpatched phones – and this device was in that danger zone.

# TL;DR – Fatal 000 Failure on Outdated Samsung

- **Incident:**  
  A Sydney resident using a **Lebara service on TPG’s network** died after their Samsung handset **failed to connect to 000**, Australia’s emergency number.

- **Cause (early findings):**  
  TPG told the ASX in a [statement](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/TPG/03024249.pdf) its network was **fully operational**; the problem likely stemmed from the handset’s **old Samsung software no longer compatible with emergency calls**.

- **Affected devices:**  
  Samsung has [listed dozens of older Galaxy models](https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/issue-with-some-older-galaxy-devices-calling-triple-zero/), including **Galaxy S7 and Note 5 series**, that must be **updated or replaced** to reliably reach Triple Zero.

- **Warnings and non-compliance:**  
  TPG says it had **repeatedly warned customers** with flagged Samsung models to update, with the latest alert on **November 7**.  
  > "Customer safety remains our highest priority... We urge all customers with outdated software to replace or update their devices without delay."

- **Regulatory backdrop:**  
  Under Australia’s **Emergency Service Call Determination**, carriers **must block** handsets that remain unable to complete 000 calls **28–35 days** after first warning. TPG insists it complied with these rules.

- **Broader concern:**  
  TPG disclosed the case due to **growing public anxiety about emergency call reliability**, following earlier failures such as **Optus’s 14‑hour 000 outage** linked to **three deaths** ([Reg story](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/21/optus_emergency_call_incident/)).

- **Industry response:**  
  - **Telstra** has already [warned](https://www.telstra.com.au/exchange/older-mobile-devices-calling-triple-zero-) that older, non‑upgradeable Samsung phones may **fail 000 calls** and face **mandatory blocking** on all networks.  
  - **Samsung**, in a post-publication statement, said it was **“deeply saddened”**, is working with carriers to ensure reliability in emergencies, and **strongly urges users to keep devices fully updated**, noting carriers have notified affected customers with instructions.

- **Government and oversight:**  
  TPG says it has informed the **federal communications minister, state authorities, the ACMA, and the Triple Zero Custodian** as the investigation continues.
