# I made a downdetector for downdetector's downdetector's downdetector

**Model:** gpt-5.1

**Reasoning Effort:** medium

**Time:** 29.65s

**Bottom line:** A meta-status site that pings a site that pings a site that pings Downdetector, then tells you if *that* is up. Nothing more, nothing less.

# TL;DR

- **What this is:** A tiny, unaffiliated status checker for [Downdetector's Downdetector's Downdetector](https://downdetectorsdowndetectorsdowndetector.com/) — i.e., **4×-removed** from Downdetector itself.
- **How it works:**  
  - Calls a minimal API  
  - That API pings *Downdetector's Downdetector's Downdetector*  
  - This site then reports HTTP status + latency as a simple table.
- **Current behavior:** Shows a single **“Global probe”** row with status, HTTP code, and latency, plus **“Last checked: Just now”** and a **Refresh** link.
- **Scope & affiliation:**  
  - Not connected to Downdetector, any of the intermediate “detectors,” or your ISP.  
  - Exists purely to answer: *“Is the thing that checks the thing that checks the thing that checks Downdetector working?”*

> “A tiny independent status checker that checks the checker that checks the checker that checks Downdetector.”
