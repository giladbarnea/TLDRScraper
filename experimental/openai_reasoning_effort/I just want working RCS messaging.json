Logs point to a Google Jibe provisioning hang Apple won\u2019t acknowledge. I want Apple to own and fix it\u2014instead they\u2019re swapping my logic board \u201cas a courtesy.\u201d\n\n# TL;DR: RCS On iPhone Is Broken And Nobody Owns It\n- Problem: On iOS 26, both my dual-SIM lines (T-Mobile, US Mobile/AT&T; even tested Verizon) are stuck on \u201cWaiting for activation.\u201d The same eSIMs activate within seconds on multiple other iPhones (14 Pro Max, SE3). This is device-specific, not carrier-specific.\n- Evidence: Live CommCenter logs flag Jibe config as not ready due to an unexpired \u201cUserInteractionRequired.xml\u201d with \u201cInfinite validity,\u201d blocking provisioning. IMS flips to kCellular; entitlement shows \u201cAllowed\u201d and \u201ckSupported.\u201d The phone never surfaces a needed user action.\n- Apple support: Underinformed and not empowered. Triage script is to deflect to carriers. Refuse in-store eSIM swaps to identical test hardware \u201cfor privacy,\u201d so they can\u2019t reproduce. Final move: logic board swap with new IMEIs, framed as a favor, not a diagnosis.\n> \u201cDo not take accountability, blame the carrier.\u201d\n- My creds: OS-agnostic power user; maintain my own LineageOS builds. Previously helped surface and fix Verizon MMS UAProf breakage ([change review](https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_oneplus_sm8250-common/%2B/333379)); understand carrier interop failures and how they manifest.\n- Context: Apple added baseline RCS (v2.4) in iOS 18; E2E promised \u201clater.\u201d Carriers in the US largely handed RCS to Google\u2019s Jibe ([docs](https://docs.jibemobile.com/) are gated). Apple support never mentions Jibe, but my logs do. Customers can\u2019t contact Jibe.\n- Google angle: Google deliberately blocked RCS on rooted/custom ROMs, admitted later ([Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-silently-blocking-rcs-rooted-android-phones-custom-roms-3421652/)), while touting 911 over RCS ([blog](https://blog.google/products/messages/google-messages-rcs-911-emergency/)). I bypassed with Pixel fingerprint spoofing\u2014so \u201canti-spam\u201d rationale rings hollow.\n- Exhaustive troubleshooting already done: every flavor of resets, toggles, eSIM reissues, IMEI swap between slots, Wi\u2011Fi Calling, 5G off, iOS betas, full device recoveries (iTunes/iCloud/new), VPN/DNS removed, waited days before reattempting, cross-device activation tests, and deep log captures via libimobiledevice.\n- Likely root cause: Apple-Jibe tokenized RCS provisioning path stuck behind a never-cleared \u201cuser interaction required\u201d state the UI never exposes\u2014possibly triggered by dual-SIM behavior, data-carrier hopping, or policy gating in Jibe\u2019s per-carrier config.\n- What I want: Accountability and proper debugging. Let engineering pull device logs and file a Radar; confirm where provisioning fails (token, entitlement, IMS gating, Jibe policy). If it\u2019s Jibe, escalate through carrier channels rather than pushing me back to retail scripts.\n- What Apple\u2019s doing instead: Board swap tomorrow. Might work because of fresh IMEIs, but it\u2019s punting\u2014not root-causing. If it\u2019s a generational/software+Jibe issue, I could hit it again, and others will too.\n- Bottom ask: I didn\u2019t change my setup from iOS 18 to 26; Apple stopped signing 18 so I can\u2019t revert. I just want working RCS messaging\u2014own the failure path and fix it.",

      "tldr_markdown": "Bottom line: RCS on my iPhone 15 Pro has been dead for a month on multiple carriers; it activates instantly on other iPhones. Apple keeps blaming \u201cthe carrier,\u201d but the logs point to a Google Jibe provisioning block that iOS isn\u2019t surfacing. I want Apple to own the issue, inspect the logs, and fix it\u2014not swap hardware and punt.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n- Problem: RCS stuck on \u201cWaiting for activation\u2026\u201d on an iPhone 15 Pro after upgrading from iOS 18 to iOS 26. Works immediately when the same eSIMs are moved to other iPhones (two 14 Pro Maxes, an SE3). Affects T\u2011Mobile, US Mobile (AT&T), and Verizon lines\u2014so not carrier-specific.\n- Background: I\u2019m OS-agnostic, run my own LineageOS builds, previously helped fix Verizon MMS UAProf breakage ([context](http://uaprof.vtext.com/sam/i515/i515.xml) dead; Apple/BlackBerry hosted their own: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/mms/uaprof.rdf), [BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com/go/mobile/profiles/uaprof/9700/5.0.0.rdf)). This isn\u2019t my first interoperability rodeo.\n- Google precedent: Google deliberately blocked RCS on rooted/custom ROMs in 2023\u2014first silently, later with a notice ([report](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-silently-blocking-rcs-rooted-android-phones-custom-roms-3421652/)). I could bypass via Pixel fingerprint spoofing. So \u201cspam prevention\u201d rings hollow if simple workarounds exist.\n- Apple\u2019s RCS: Apple finally shipped baseline RCS (v2.4) in iOS 18; E2E may land later. My RCS worked on iOS 18; broke only after iOS 26\u2014no config changes beyond the upgrade.\n- Evidence: Device logs show Jibe-related provisioning roadblock with \u201cInfinite validity of UserInteractionRequired.xml,\u201d IMS \u201cnot ready,\u201d entitlement \u201cAllowed,\u201d token-based provisioning selected\u2014iOS never prompts me. Looks like an unhandled Jibe \u201cuser interaction\u201d gate blocking activation.\n- Likely root cause: US carriers offloaded RCS to Google Jibe ([docs](https://docs.jibemobile.com/)). Apple support isn\u2019t trained on Jibe, so they default to blaming \u201cthe carrier,\u201d masking the real dependency chain (Apple iOS RCS client \u2194 carrier provisioning \u2194 Google Jibe).\n- Repro isolation: Same lines/eSIMs immediately activate on other iPhones; my 15 Pro fails across three carriers. Strongly points to a device/OS/Jibe provisioning edge case, not carrier accounts or network.\n- Exhaustive troubleshooting already done: Network resets, toggles (RCS/iMessage/5G/airplane), VPN/DNS removal, eSIM re-issues, E911/Wi\u2011Fi calling, SIM-to-other-IMEI, multiple full wipes and restores (iTunes/iCloud, betas), new-device setup, days-long cool-off, inbound upgrade triggers, live syslogs via libimobiledevice. No dice.\n- Apple support posture: No accountability, refuses in-store eSIM transfer-to-like device for isolation \u201cfor privacy.\u201d Now proposing a board swap (new IMEIs). That\u2019s a time sink and doesn\u2019t address the underlying software/Jibe provisioning issue.\n- What I want: Apple to pull a proper radar, read the logs, engage with Jibe if needed, and fix the provisioning/interaction flow. Don\u2019t make users eat time and money because RCS is now a three-party system.\n\n> \u201cDo not take accountability, blame the carrier.\u201d",

Unexpired : UserInteractionRequired.xml`\n\n- Hypothesis: Jibe has flagged this device state as needing some user interaction that **iOS never surfaces**, so provisioning is permanently blocked.\n\n---\n\n# Structural Problem: Apple Support Process Is Broken for This\n\n- Apple frontline guidance boils down to:  \n  > **\u201cDo not take accountability, blame the carrier.\u201d**\n- In-store support:\n  - Repeatedly blames \u201csoftware\u201d even after **multiple complete reloads**.\n  - Refuses to **test the user\u2019s eSIM on an in-store 15 Pro** \u201cfor privacy reasons\u201d, blocking proper A/B testing.\n  - No one mentions **Google Jibe** even once; employees seem **unaware** US RCS is actually hosted by Google, not the carriers.\n- Author has **no channel to Google Jibe**: docs are carrier-only ([docs.jibemobile.com](https://docs.jibemobile.com/)). Walking into a store saying \u201cI think this is a Jibe failure\u201d is practically absurd.\n\n---\n\n# Apple\u2019s \u201cSolution\u201d: Swap the Board, Shrug, Move On\n\n- Since the user **won\u2019t accept \u201cgo bug T\u2011Mobile/US Mobile\u201d**, Apple will:\n  - **Replace the logic board**, changing IMEIs\u2014hoping Jibe provisioning resets.\n  - Frame it as a **\u201ccourtesy\u201d**, insist they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s their issue.\n- Critique:\n  - Costs the user **time, fuel**, and doesn\u2019t address the underlying bug.\n  - No one is actually **analyzing logs**, so the bug could recur or affect others.\n  - Author bought **AppleCare+** expecting real troubleshooting, not parts roulette.\n\n---\n\n# What the Author Actually Wants\n\n- Not a new board; a **real root-cause fix** and visibility:\n  - Proper internal bug (Radar) filed with log analysis.\n  - Clarity on where RCS provisioning failed:  \n    - Dual\u2011SIM? Rapid carrier switching? Jibe token state?  \n    - Change from iOS 18 \u2192 26 with same config?\n- Broader complaint:  \n  - **Closed systems** (Apple, Google/Jibe) plus **opaque support scripts** leave technically capable users unable to **fix or even understand** failures that they used to debug themselves on open platforms.\n\n> \u201cI use opensource software not because it\u2019s inherently better, but rather because I can at least triage, understand, and fix problems.\u201d",
