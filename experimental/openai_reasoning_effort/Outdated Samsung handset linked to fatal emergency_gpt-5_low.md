Bottom line: A Sydney death is linked to an outdated Samsung phone that couldn’t reach 000; TPG says its network worked, blames old device software, and cites mandated blocks for unpatched handsets. Samsung urges immediate updates or replacements.

# TL;DR

- **Warnings and compliance:** TPG says it warned impacted users multiple times, most recently Nov 7. Under federal rules, carriers must block handsets that still can’t complete 000 after 28–35 days unpatched; TPG says it followed this.
- **Industry context:** Telstra also warned last month about older, non-upgradeable Samsung phones failing 000 and facing mandatory blocking nationwide. [Telstra note](https://www.telstra.com.au/exchange/older-mobile-devices-calling-triple-zero-)

- **Samsung response (update):** Offers condolences; says it’s working with carriers; urges customers to keep devices updated or replace if required.
- **Backdrop:** Earlier this year, Optus admitted a firewall update blocked emergency calls for 14 hours, linked to three deaths. [Report](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/21/optus_emergency_call_incident/)

  > “This is a tragic incident... We urge all customers with outdated software to replace or update their devices without delay.”
