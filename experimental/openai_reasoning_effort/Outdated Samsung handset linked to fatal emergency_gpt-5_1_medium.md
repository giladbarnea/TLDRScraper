# Outdated Samsung handset linked to fatal emergency call failure in Australia

**URL:** https://theregister.com/2025/11/18/samsung_emergency_call_failure

**Model:** gpt-5.1

**Reasoning Effort:** medium

**Time:** 272.4s

---

**Bottom line:** An Australian died after their Samsung phone couldn’t dial 000; telco TPG blames outdated Samsung software on older Galaxy devices, not its network, and regulators may now probe emergency-call reliability across carriers and handsets.

---

# TL;DR

## What happened

- **A Sydney resident died** when their Samsung handset failed to connect to **000**, Australia’s main emergency number, while using a **Lebara service on TPG’s network**.
- **TPG says its network was fully operational** and early investigation points to **Samsung handset software that’s no longer compatible with emergency calling**.

## Devices and software at fault

- **Samsung has acknowledged an issue on “certain older devices”** and published a list of affected models that must be **updated or replaced** to ensure 000 works, including **Galaxy S7 and Note 5 series**.
- The dead customer’s phone was on that list and **had not been updated despite multiple warnings** from TPG, the last on **November 7**.
- Telstra separately [warned](https://www.telstra.com.au/exchange/older-mobile-devices-calling-triple-zero-) that **older, non-upgradeable Samsung phones** may also fail when calling 000 and would be **blocked from all Australian networks** if not fixed.

## Regulatory obligations and telco stance

- Under Australia’s **Emergency Service Call Determination**, operators must **block handsets that can’t complete 000 calls** if they stay unpatched **28–35 days after the first warning**.  
- TPG says it **followed this rule** and disclosed the incident to the **ASX** due to **“heightened public concern”** over emergency call reliability.
- TPG has notified the **federal communications minister, state authorities, ACMA, and the Triple Zero Custodian** and continues to investigate.
- CEO Iñaki Berroeta stressed:
  > "This is a tragic incident... We urge all customers with outdated software to replace or update their devices without delay."

## Samsung’s response

- In a later statement, Samsung expressed condolences and said it is **“working closely with our carrier partners”** to ensure reliable operation in emergencies.
- It strongly urged customers to **keep devices updated**:
  > "We strongly encourage customers to keep their mobile devices updated with the latest software, as this is critical to maintaining the highest standards of safety, security, and performance."

## Bigger picture: 000 reliability under scrutiny

- The incident comes after **Optus admitted** a **firewall update** earlier this year **knocked out emergency calling for 14 hours**, an outage **linked to three deaths**.
- Combined, these failures highlight **systemic fragility in Australia’s emergency-call ecosystem**—from **network changes** to **aging, unpatched handsets**—with mounting **public and regulatory pressure** on both telcos and handset makers.
