A plan and a review of thet plan have both been devised and written to thoughts/25-12-16-fix-cache-scrape-today-edge-case/*.md. You are tasked with judging which case is more valid — the plan or its criticiser — and reaching a finalized conclusion. Whatever your verdict will be, it will be picked and acted upon. 

1. **Read and Understand the Plan and its Reivew**
   - Study the two docs
   - Understand the problem being solved, the proposed solutions and the counter arguments of the review

2. **Identify Knowledge Gaps**
   - Think about what context you're lacking to assess this plan properly
   - What do you need to know about the codebase architecture?
   - If you haven't already, start by reading AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
   - What flows, components, or patterns are relevant?
   - Study all the files relevant, impact on, and potentially impacted by the proposed changes

3. **Research the Codebase**
   - Study all aspects of the codebase relevant to this plan
   - Liberally use codebase-researching agents to gain a deep understanding of all parts of the codebase relevant to this plan

4. **Re-evaluate with Context**
   - Go back to the plan and its review with your renewed understanding
   - Read them critically with full context

5. Consider the quality of the cases and arguments, then conclude which approach should be taken by implementers. Weigh your judgment by the truthfulness of the assumptions and conclusions made by each party. write your verdict to a file alongside the markdown files you've read.
