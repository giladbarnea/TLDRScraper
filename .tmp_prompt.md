A plan and a review of thet plan have both been devised and written to thoughts/25-12-16-fix-cache-scrape-today-edge-case/*.md. You are tasked with judging which case is more valid — the plan or its criticiser — and reaching a finalized conclusion. Whatever your verdict will be, it will be picked and acted upon.

1. **Read and Understand the Plan and its Reivew**
   - Study the two docs
   - Understand the problem being solved, the proposed solutions and the counter arguments of the review

2. **Identify Knowledge Gaps**
   - Think about what context you're lacking to assess this plan properly
   - What do you need to know about the codebase architecture?
   - What flows, components, or patterns are relevant?

3. **Research the Codebase**
   - Study all aspects of the codebase relevant to this plan
   - Liberally use codebase-researching agents to gain a deep understanding of all parts of the codebase relevant to this plan

4. **Re-evaluate with Context**
   - Go back to the plan and its review with your renewed understanding
   - Read them critically with full context

5. Consider the quality of the cases and arguments, then conclude which approach ahould be taken by implementers. write your verdict to a file alongside the markdown files you've read.
