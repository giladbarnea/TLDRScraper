Run setup.sh, then the catchup skill (.claude/skills/). Generate the project tree. Currently, the client always rescrapes "today" on refresh, which is desired but blocks the page load. I want to display any available articles immediately, rescrape today in the background, then merge in any new entries to the client. I need an elegant, simple and robust design from you for that. Do a generous research, cast a very wide net, there almost no such thing as "too much context" here. Then write your design to thoughts/26-02-05-rescrape-in-background/plan-2.md.
