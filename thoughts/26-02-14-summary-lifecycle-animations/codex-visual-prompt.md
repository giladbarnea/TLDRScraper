First, read and internalize the catchup skill at `.claude/skills/catchup/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions. Point your catchup to the `thoughts/` subdirectory so you are caught up on the ongoing effort.

Then, read these files thoroughly:
- `thoughts/26-02-14-summary-lifecycle-animations/discussion.md`
- `thoughts/26-02-14-summary-lifecycle-animations/technical-spec.md`
- `thoughts/26-02-14-summary-lifecycle-animations/visual-spec.md`
- `client/CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`

Now, here is your task:

I consider the technical aspect of the animations complete. Let's shift our focus on the visual aspect.

Ultrathink how each animation in the lifecycle should look like. It needs to look and feel polished, precise, not overly done, not cartoonish/cheap, not underwhelming. Remember the gaming notion but lean triple A fantasy for Magic (Elder Scrolls damage-oriented mage, lord of the rings, Harry potter, etc) and/or fighting games for "power" (Tekken, Dragonball).

Do not change any code. After thinking deeply, write your suggestions to a new file: `thoughts/26-02-14-summary-lifecycle-animations/codex-visual-suggestions.md`.
