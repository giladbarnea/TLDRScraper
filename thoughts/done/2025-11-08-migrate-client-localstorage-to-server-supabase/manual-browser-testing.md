# Manual Browser Testing

Executed a comprehensive manual test plan covering all critical user flows. Verified that newsletter scraping works with both cache hits and misses. Confirmed that article states (read, removed) are correctly persisted to Supabase and reflected in the UI across page reloads. Tested TLDR generation and persistence. Validated that loading states are displayed correctly during async operations and that error handling functions as expected for network issues. Confirmed the UI remains responsive and visual states match the previous localStorage implementation.

COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.
