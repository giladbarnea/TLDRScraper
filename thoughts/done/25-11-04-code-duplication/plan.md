# Code Duplication Refactoring Plan

Addressed three duplication hotspots: unified section parsing in `tldr_adapter.py`, centralized the newsletter scrape storage key helper, and consolidated article normalization in `newsletter_scraper.py`. Reduced redundant code while keeping scrape outputs identical.

COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.
