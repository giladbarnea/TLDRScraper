# Mixed Concerns Refactoring Plan

Split `_build_scrape_response` into focused helpers and collapsed duplicate markdown parsing paths in `tldr_adapter.py` so parsing happens once for both articles and metadata. Simplified scrape orchestration while keeping outputs unchanged.

COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.
