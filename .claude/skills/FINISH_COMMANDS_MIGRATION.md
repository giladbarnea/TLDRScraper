# Analysis: New Wisdom from Official skill-creator

After studying the official skill-creator, I've identified several powerful opportunities to enhance our migrated skills. Here's what I've learned:

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Description is THE Primary Triggering Mechanism
Our current descriptions are too brief. The official guidance says:

> "Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it. Include ALL 'when to use' information here - Not in the body."

**Current example (plan):**
```yaml
description: Create detailed implementation plans based on thorough research and deep thinking
```

**Should be more like:**
```yaml
description: Create detailed implementation plans based on thorough research and deep thinking. Use when the user asks to plan a feature, design an implementation, create a technical specification, or needs a structured approach to a complex task. Also use when tasks require multiple steps, architectural decisions, cross-system changes, or database migrations.
```

### 2. Progressive Disclosure: Split Large SKILL.md Files into References

Official guidance: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Move detailed content to `references/` files.

**Our current state:**
* `plan/SKILL.md`: 389 lines &larr; Getting close to limit
* `architecture-create/SKILL.md`: 174 lines
* `research-codebase/SKILL.md`: 147 lines

**Opportunities:**
* **plan**: Could extract the plan template to `references/plan-template.md`
* **architecture-create**: Could extract the original creation prompt to `references/architecture-creation-guide.md`
* **architecture-sync-current-changes**: Already has an embedded `<original-architecture-md-creation-prompt>` that could be `references/original-prompt.md`

---

### 3. Bundled Resources Pattern - We're Not Using It At All

Skills can include:
* `scripts/` - Executable code for deterministic tasks
* `references/` - Documentation loaded as needed
* `assets/` - Templates and boilerplate used in output

**Current state:** We have ZERO bundled resources across all skills.

**Opportunities:**

| Skill | Possible References | Possible Scripts | Possible Assets |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| plan | plan-template.md, examples.md, common-patterns.md | - | - |
| review-plan | review-checklist.md, common-antipatterns.md | - | - |
| architecture-create | creation-guide.md, examples.md | - | - |
| research-codebase | research-patterns.md, query-examples.md | - | - |
| implement-plan | implementation-checklist.md, testing-guide.md | - | - |

### 4. Context Window Economy

Official guidance:
> "The context window is a public good. Default assumption: Claude is already very smart. Only add context Claude doesn't already have."

Our plan skill (389 lines) includes:
* A detailed 88-line plan template embedded in `SKILL.md`
* Extensive sub-task spawning best practices (30+ lines)
* Common patterns section (20+ lines)

These could be `references/` that Claude loads only when needed.

### 5. Optional Frontmatter for Enhanced Control

We could add these optional fields where beneficial:

**For manual-only skills:**
```yaml
disable-model-invocation: true  # Prevents Claude from auto-triggering
```

**For skills with specific tool needs:**
```yaml
allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob]  # Restricts to read-only operations
```

**For complex skills that should run in isolation:**
```yaml
context: fork
agent: Plan
```

**Which skills might benefit:**
* `architecture-sync-*`: Could set `disable-model-invocation: true` (manual-only)
* `implement-plan`: Could set `allowed-tools` to include `Bash, Edit, Write`
* `review-plan`: Could run as forked context with `agent: Plan`

---

### 6. Sequential Workflow Pattern

Official guidance shows clear patterns for multi-step processes:

```text
Filling a PDF form involves these steps:

1. Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
2. Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
3. Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
4. Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
5. Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

**Our skills that could benefit:**
* **plan**: Already has good sequential structure
* **review-plan**: Steps are buried in prose, could be surfaced as numbered workflow
* **implement-plan**: Has steps but could be clearer

---

### 7. Remove Extraneous Fields?

Official skill-creator says:
> "Do not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter" (only name and description)

But our current skills have:
* `model: inherit`
* `argument-hint: ...`
* `last_updated: ...`

**My assessment:**
* `last_updated`: Auto-generated by CI (per CLAUDE.md), keep it
* `model: inherit`: Optional field from full schema, harmless to keep
* `argument-hint`: Optional field, provides value for UX, keep it

These don't hurt and provide value, so we can keep them.

## Summary of Enhancement Opportunities

**High Impact (should definitely do):**
1. **Enhance descriptions** with comprehensive triggering contexts
2. **Extract embedded content** to `references/` for context efficiency:
   * `plan/references/plan-template.md`
   * `plan/references/sub-task-best-practices.md`
   * `architecture-*/references/creation-guide.md`
   * `review-plan/references/review-checklist.md`

**Medium Impact (nice to have):**
3. **Add references** with examples and patterns for each skill
4. **Add `disable-model-invocation: true`** for manual-only skills (`architecture-sync-*`)
5. **Surface workflows** as numbered steps at the beginning of each `SKILL.md`

**Low Impact (optional):**
6. **Add `allowed-tools`** restrictions where appropriate
7. **Consider `context: fork`** for `review-plan`

## What We Did vs. What We Can Do:

**What we did (Precision):**
* ✅ Moved files to new structure
* ✅ Preserved all frontmatter
* ✅ Maintained git history
* ✅ Everything still works

**What we can do (Recall/Power):**
* 📈 Make descriptions work harder for auto-triggering
* 📦 Leverage bundled resources for context efficiency
* 🎯 Use progressive disclosure to keep context lean
* ⚙️ Add optional frontmatter for better control
* 📋 Structure workflows more explicitly

Do you want me to implement these enhancements? I would suggest starting with the high-impact changes (descriptions and references), then iterating based on your preference.
