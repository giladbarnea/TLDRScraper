Before you start, verbatim prompt run-codex.sh with the paragraph above (only change to write to $ARGUMENTS). Run it in a background shell. Then forget about it and proceed with your instructions.
Codex can take >10 minutes to complete the task, so if you've completed yours before it, await in 120 seconds intervals.

Then read the file it output and consider whether there's anything to take/cherry pick from it.
To adopt any notion, it has to answer all of the following criteria:
1. It doesn't increase the overall design complexity (non-negotiable). Conversely, it gains points if it reduces complexity.
2. It's either better from your alternative, or it increases the cohesiveness/elegance of the overall design.

We can talk about it and make the decision together.
